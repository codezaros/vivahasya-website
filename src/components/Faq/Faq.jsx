    question: "How far in advance should we book your services?",

  {
    question: "Do you offer partial planning or just full-service?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle unexpected weather changes for outdoor events?",
    answer: "We always create a 'Plan B' during the initial design phase. Whether it's high-quality marquees or a quick venue flip, we ensure the transition is seamless and aesthetic."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with specific vendors only?",
    answer: "We have a curated list of trusted partners, but we are always open to working with new vendors who meet our standards of excellence and reliability."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical investment for your services?",
    answer: "Because every wedding is unique, our fees vary based on the scale and complexity of the event. We provide a detailed proposal after our initial consultation."
